Satus codes

404 - not found
mdn documentation

indicate whether a specific http request has been successfully completed.
400 - 499 : client error, password wrong
404 - your mistake not existing page

500 -599 : server error, db connection error

200 ok, on api code - standard response for http successful request

Post, some put request: 201 created, also successful. new resource was created.

res.status(201).json({})

i need to restart the server everytime

package nodemon

npm replace nodemon
on ctrl+s checks changes in files, and restarts.

204 - req, successful but don't want to send any content in return.

client error response

400 - bad request, something in payload missing

in post

if(!body || !body.firstname || !body.email || !body.lastname) {
return res.status(400).json({msg: all fields are required.})
}

making things sensible.

401 - unauthorized

facebook req send, not login, so unauthorized, unauthenticated.

402 - payment required
no stable
if you are using any service, card or credits are exhausted, then can send 402 payment required. so you can't do this and payment is required.

403 - forbidden
logged in but no permission to access anything or perform any activity.

404 - express handles automatically by it self, show example.
also we can use customly, like if no id found in find by id api, then send 404
if(!user) return res.status(404).json({msg: user not found.})


500 - server error response.
server has an error.

501 - not implemented yet.

300 - redirection response

payment server - redirection for payment or a service which is using short urls.

bitly, user gives url and we shorten the url.
