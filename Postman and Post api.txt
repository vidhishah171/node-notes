Browser can't call post, put, delete, patch
Postman is a utility tool which helps us for api testing and documentation

when we do npm start, it runs on localhost:8000, we had to open browser and run endpoint

http://localhost:8000/users : http for localhost: as we don't have ssl certificate

200 : everything is good, sucessful, time, size

To test your apis, decrease your time - that is your intention

Body:
www.form.url encoded: form in website
firstname, lastname, email, gender, jobtitle

need to use fs module as we don;t have db.


//apply middleware: plugin, middleware
app.use(express.urlencoded({extended: false})) // will enter form data into body
// runs on every request, takes data, creates js object and added to req.body


app.post("/api/users", (req,res) => {
const body = req.body; //whatever data we send from frontend in body, payload is available in body
console.log(body) //undefined: because express doesn't know what type of data it is, how is it handled, for that we need to use middleware, as of now we can understand it as a plugin. There are many plugins in express, next lec.
return res.json({status: "Pending"})
})

to add in mock data.


const fs = require("fs")

users.push({...body, id: users.length+1})
fs.writeFile('./mockdata.json', Json.stringify(users), (err,data) => {
return res.json({status: "Sucess", id: users.length})})

Here we are generating id manually, in real world database will generate the id,
real world create api logic

you have to implement patch and delete request
