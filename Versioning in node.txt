Versioning in node js

version 1.0.0

^4.18.2

Version
3 parts
1st part = 4 - minor
2nd part = 18 - recommended
3rd part = 2 - major

3rd part (last part) - minor fixes (Optional update)
Latest -> 4.18.2 - typo, bug, minor changes
I'll check for the documentation first and then decide

npmjs.com
search for express - latest version

2nd Part: 18 - Recommended Bug Fix (Security fix)
Latest -> 4.19.1 added recommended bug fix or added new feature

New route, new profile page - adding a feature, change in second part, critical security bug

Check change log

3rd Part: Major Release - Major/ Breaking update
you're very cautious
Existing application might can break, 
if building new application you can use new version
check documentation

npm uninstall express
by default installs latest version
npm install express@4.17.2 - to install specific version


^ compatible with version 
4th version

^4.18.2 | 4.18.2 -> <5.0.0
keep default version as 18, can change 18 and 2

npm update
npm install 

4.18.3
4.18.4

^- install all recommended and minor fixes automatically, doesn't ask the admin
doesn't update 4 to 5 major release automatically, versions which are compatible with 4th version, update automatically

~4.18.1 
Approximately equivalent to version
